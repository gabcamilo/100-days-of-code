# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a [memory game](https://github.com/gabcamilo/memory-game) with JavaScript coding along with [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/) by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** As it's Saturday thought I could learn from something fun, so I tried simple game development.

**New Concepts I've Learned:**

1. **DOMContentLoaded** event listener: fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images and subframes to finish loading.

## Day 1: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the [whack a mole](https://gabcamilo.github.io/whack-a-mole/) game, also with JavaScript and coding along with [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/) by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** It was fun, but I guess I have to leave my confort zone.

## Day 2: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented storing user information at a database on Firebase for a little e-commerce [project](https://github.com/gabcamilo/crwn-clothing) I'm doing to learn React.

**Thoughts:** Firebase is an excellent resource that I wasn't really aware of. Glad I'm learning something new.

## Day 3: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: At the [e-commerce project](https://github.com/gabcamilo/crwn-clothing), finished user sign up adding SignUp component to allow users to register with email and password.
I also started to take a look at a multiplayer game tutorial, guess I can actually work on it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**: Not many thoughts today, I'm still learning how to deal with the Firebase integration.

## Day 4: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a little multiplayer game from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvktZnZn6A&list=PLMdYygf53DP5SVQQrkKCVWDS0TwYLVitL&index=6) (PT-br).

**Thoughts:**: Every day I realize I really need to work on my CSS skills. Also, canvas is awesome!

## Day 5: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked again on the multiplayer game from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvktZnZn6A&list=PLMdYygf53DP5SVQQrkKCVWDS0TwYLVitL&index=6) (PT-br). Implemented *observers* pattern.

**Thoughts:**: Learned a lot about different architectures than the ones I'm used to. Awesome day!

## Day 6: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I couldn't spend as much time as I'd like coding but worked on the multiplayer game.

**Thoughts:**:  I'm very excited to finish it. Already learned a lot.

## Day 7: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created modules from the functions previously implemented on the multiplayer game. Also, learned a little about the history of modules.

**Thoughts:**:  I had never used modules in front-end without any framework. It was an interesting approach and now I'm more aware of the perks of using it.

## Day 8: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added socket.io to handle a player's connection, disconnection, and moving at the multiplayer game.

**Thoughts:**:  Get socket.io to work in a more complex way was awesome! I'm very excited to learn more, and for sure I'll have to revisit some parts of the code to understand better some aspects of it.

## Day 9: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the SignIn component of the [e-commerce project](https://github.com/gabcamilo/crwn-clothing), also started the studies of Redux.

**Thoughts:**:  Very excited to finally learn Redux!

## Day 10: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Studied a bit of Redux.

**Thoughts:**: It really makes sense!
