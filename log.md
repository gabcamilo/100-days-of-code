# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a [memory game](https://github.com/gabcamilo/memory-game) with JavaScript coding along with [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/) by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** As it's Saturday thought I could learn from something fun, so I tried simple game development.

**New Concepts I've Learned:**

1. **DOMContentLoaded** event listener: fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images and subframes to finish loading.

## Day 1: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the [whack a mole](https://gabcamilo.github.io/whack-a-mole/) game, also with JavaScript and coding along with [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/) by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** It was fun, but I guess I have to leave my confort zone.

## Day 2: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented storing user information at a database on Firebase for a little e-commerce [project](https://github.com/gabcamilo/crwn-clothing) I'm doing to learn React.

**Thoughts:** Firebase is an excellent resource that I wasn't really aware of. Glad I'm learning something new.

## Day 3: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: At the [e-commerce project](https://github.com/gabcamilo/crwn-clothing), finished user sign up adding SignUp component to allow users to register with email and password.
I also started to take a look at a multiplayer game tutorial, guess I can actually work on it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**: Not many thoughts today, I'm still learning how to deal with the Firebase integration.
