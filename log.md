# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a [memory game](https://github.com/gabcamilo/memory-game) with JavaScript coding along with [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/) by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** As it's Saturday thought I could learn from something fun, so I tried simple game development.

**New Concepts I've Learned:**

1. **DOMContentLoaded** event listener: fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images and subframes to finish loading.
